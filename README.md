# vtk-mesh-voxelization-volume

A working algorithm for vtk which will, at present, create a sphere and obtain the volume of it using mesh voxelization and then counting the voxels. This will be expanded upon in the coming days/weeks but I wanted to get it up quickly.

Includes a bunch of additional stuff which was used in testing to create the algorithm. Most of the important stuff is in the PolyDataToImageData folder.
